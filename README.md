# Snowplow ID service examples

This repository includes [ID service](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/javascript-trackers/browser-tracker/browser-tracker-v3-reference/advanced-usage/using-an-id-service/) examples in different systems/frameworks/languages that can be used as a guideline for the main business logic and code.

## Structure

The folder structure for including a new example is per-language and per-system/framework. Finally the filename can reveal any kind of extra information to put the example into context.

E.g. An ID service written in TypeScript for the Next.js framework as an API route would probably fit the folder structure of `examples/typescript/Next.js/api-route.ts`.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute your own example and use-case.
